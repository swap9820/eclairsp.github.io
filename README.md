# flix

A project I made to learn React. Not that great but an attempt.

###### [DEMO](https://eclairsp.github.io/flix/)

I made it using: 
- React
- [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
- React Router 
- Saas

Stuff I may add: 
- Full cast and crew.
- Recommendtions.
- People (actors, directors etc) details page.

Some work still needs to be done: 
- Better implementaion of Seacrh as now I use Search and SeacrhMovie
- It's not fully responsive. 
- Also I have to arrange everything in the src folder.

To upload to github pages used the following two guides: 
- To upload files correctly and for SPA without React Router using [this](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).
- To make everything work correctly using React Router used [this](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).
